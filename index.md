### Experience and Academic Goals 
Link to my personal section: [Link Text](#personal-interests).


I am currently a fourth year Math-CS student at <ins>UCSD</ins>. 
Some of my goals before graduation are: 
  - Become more familiar with Git commands. Some commands I am interested to learn more about are `git status`, `git branch` and `git log`.
  - Complete some LeetCode problems.
  - Connect with more professors and peers.


Below are some goals I will be working towards after graduation: 
- [ ] Begin my Master's degree
- [ ] Find more people to collaborate on fun side projects with
- [ ] Go to a hackathon
      
After graduation I hope to find a full-time position close by so I can stay in San Diego. My time at UCSD has given me experience in the following skills: 
  1. C++
  2. Java
  3. Github
  4. ARM

### Personal Interests
Outside of academics, I am really passionate about nature and sustainability. I had always been interested in these topics but it became more of a passion when I began listing to [National Park After Dark](https://www.npadpodcast.com), a podcast centered on stories and current issues within the National Park Service. 
My fondness for the outdoors often leads me to Yosemite and other beautiful parks in California, where I am able to experience views like [this](docs/yose.md).
